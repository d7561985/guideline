== Health check
Health check should check all repo stack for responsibility.

Each linked database should pinged (`SELECT 1`)

=== HTTP
Service always should provide `/health` endpoint.

==== response status code
Header status should always be: `200`. Real status code should be in body.

==== response body
Successful response <string>: `OK`

Example:

[source,json]
----
{"status":200, "response":"OK"}
----

=== gRPC
Service should always provide

* Each linked database should pinged (`SELECT 1`)

* Each gRPC service should provide

WARNING: On error we always should write in stdout errors vise-versa we don't understand what is going on.

== Code-generation
For easyjson / gRPC we let CI to do that. But for mock developer save in repo generated data.

Makefile:
[source,bash]
----
generate:
	rm -vf model/*easyjson.go
	go generate \
		model/xxx.go \
		model/yyy.go \
		model/zzz.go
	go generate ./...
